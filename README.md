## Overview

### The challenge

The goal was to build an IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I used the recommended [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) to identify the IPs and [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) to generate the map.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap - for ready-made form components
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - for styling
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

The initial idea was to build this in React but I wanted to complete it in the time I set for myself so I went the easier route. For future development, the overall interface will be improved and will be done in React with Tailwindcss

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - My new favorite css framework! Tailwind makes styling so much easier without going back and forth between a style sheet and your HTML file. Goodbye Bootstrap for styling.
